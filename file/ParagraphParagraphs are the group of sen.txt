ParagraphParagraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a certain topic. It is a very important form of writing as 
we write almost everything in paragraphs, be it an answer, essay, story, emails, etc. We can say that a well-structured paragraph 
is the essence of good writing. The purposes of the paragraph are to give information, to explain something, to tell a story, and 
to convince someone that our idea is right.


Paragraphs are blocks of textual content that segment out a larger piece of writing—stories, novels, articles, creative writing, or 
professional writing portions—making it less complicated to read and understand. Excellent paragraphs are an available writing 
skill for plenty of types of literature, and proper writers can substantially beautify the clarity of their news, essays, or 
fiction writing whilst constructing nicely.Prg
